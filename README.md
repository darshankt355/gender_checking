# Indian Name Gender Predictor (Flask Project)

This is my **first Flask project** ðŸŽ‰ â€” a simple web application that predicts gender based on the last letter of an Indian name.  
In many Indian languages, **most girls' names end with `a`, `i`, or `u`**, so this project uses that cultural pattern as its prediction logic.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Simple and clean UI
- Input a name and get an instant gender prediction
- Flask backend with HTML/CSS frontend
- Runs locally on your machine




**Logic Used:**
- If the name ends with **a**, **i**, or **u** â†’ Predicted **Female**
- Else â†’ Predicted **Male**

Example:

Example:
shilpa â†’ Female
rahul â†’ Male

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Flask**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **Bootstrap** (optional for styling)
